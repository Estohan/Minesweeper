# Minesweeper
##   A Linux ncurses terminal based Minesweeper game



###### Installation

*  The game can be compiled from source using the existing Makefile (with the 
rule: *make*). It can also be directly downloaded from the *Executable/* 
folder.



###### Usage

*  When run with no parameters it uses the ncurses library to create a fancy 
interface for the player. If for some reason it does not work, the game can
also be run with the parameter *1* (*./Minesweeper 1*) to enter text based
input/output mode.

*  In future versions support for Windows systems is planned as well as a
more polished version of the text based game mode.
